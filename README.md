# comPyler by Kyle Guss


building a compiler from scratch in python

requires python OR python3 installed

run from terminal instructions for lexical analyzer: 

    "git clone https://github.com/diddlypop/compyler.git"
    "cd compyler/"
    "python lex.py (file name)" or "python3 lex.py (file name)"
    
    This program comes with two test input files:
        "input1.txt" and "input2.txt"
        
    If you would like to test against a new file, add into compyler/
    
    Ex. of testing input2.txt:
        "python lex.py input2.txt"
